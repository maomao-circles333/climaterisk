    "The [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) standard is a digital format for distributing geospatial vector data and its associated attributes. The standard—first developed by [ESRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri) roughly 30 years ago—is supported by most modern GIS software tools. The name \"shapefile\" is a bit misleading because a \"shapefile\" typically consists of a bundle of several files (some mandatory, some optional) stored in a common directory with a common filename prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The shapefile format stores the geometry as primitive geometric shapes like points, lines, and polygons. These shapes, together with data attributes that are linked to each shape, create the representation of the geographic data. The term \"shapefile\" is quite common, but the format consists of a collection of files with a common filename prefix, stored in the same directory. The three mandatory files have filename extensions .shp, .shx, and .dbf. The actual shapefile relates specifically to the .shp file, but alone is incomplete for distribution as the other supporting files are required. Legacy GIS software may expect that the filename prefix be limited to eight characters to conform to the DOS 8.3 filename convention, though modern software applications accept files with longer names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapefiles use the [*Well-Known Binary (WKB)*](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkb/) format for encoding geometries. This is a compact tabular format, i.e., row and column numbers ass value is significant. Some minor limitations of this format include the restriction of attribute field names to 10 characters or fewer and poor Unicode support; as a result, text is often abbreviated and encoded in ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to the [ESRI Shapefile Technical Whitepaper](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf) to find out more about shapefiles."
